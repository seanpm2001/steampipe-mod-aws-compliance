# Overview of RBI ITF NBFC

The NBFC (Non-Banking Finance Company) sector has grown in size and complexity over the years. As the NBFC industry matures and achieves scale, its Information Technology /Information Security (IT/IS) framework, Business continuity planning (BCP), Disaster Recovery (DR) Management, IT audit, etc. must be benchmarked to best practices. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued guidelines on IT Governance, IT Security, IS Audit, BCP and DR, etc. for the NBFC sector. The RBI ITF NBFC is a comprehensive framework that provides guidance on the implementation of these guidelines.
